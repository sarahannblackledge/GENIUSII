# From DICOM to MATLAB app:
## Pipeline for converting Raystation dicom exports into anonymized niftis for use in ITK-SNAP and bespoke MATLAB app

### System Requirements:

### Destination File Structure:
All of the niftis generated through useage of this code are automatically saved into a user-specified directory (e.g. /Users/sblackledge/Documents/nifti_dump). The code will automatically create 'images' and 'masks' sub-directories. Each of these sub-directories will contain additional sub-directories corresponding to the user-specified patient name (e.g. 'g01', 'g02, etc.). The figure below demonstrates the final hierarchy:
